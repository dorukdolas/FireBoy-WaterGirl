To run, You can enter the path of the file to the terminal and compile it with 'javac * .java' and then run it with 'java Main'.

This is a project I did on my own for fun.

You can change the player's color with the 1-2-3 keys in the game.

1=Red, the player with this color shoots red. 2=Blue, the player with this color shoots blue. 3=Magenta, the player with this color cannot shoot but jumps more.

Monsters have 3 colors:

The red monster can only be killed with blue bullets.

Likewise, the blue monster can only be killed with red bullets.

If you shoot with the same color as the monster, the monster's health increases (starting health is 3).

You need to pass the Blue and Red platforms with the correct color (turning into the same color as the platform), otherwise the game will start again.

The yellow platform will take you up when you step on it.

Light colored blocks are inactive blocks. To activate them, you need to find the first place (believe me, it is not in a difficult place. d). It is already easy to open the next blocks.

Our normally small blocks are also timed blocks, you will have 3 seconds from the moment you interact with them. It disappears after the period ends.

The pink block on the top right is our finish line, the game ends as soon as you get there.


The player can only move with W-A-S-D.

You can pause the game by pressing the 'P' key.

You can shoot with the 'SPACE' key.
